Using the CLI, create a plain text file (.txt) that contains the commands necessary to answer the following questions:

1. How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

To create a hidden file or folder in CLI, we can add a ‘.’ (DOT) in front of the name of the folder or file. 

mkdir .hack (to create a hidden folder)

or

touch .message (to create a hidden file)

To display it in the CLI we simply type ‘ls –alF’.

[ls –a] shows files starting with a ‘.’

[l] shows full list with size, permissions and number of files in the directory 

[F] is to add / for directories..

2. How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

mkdir –p cemal/these/folders/are/just/for/fun



3. How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be: 
first message
second message 

In the working folder;

touch message.txt
vim message.txt

This directs us to Vim.
Here we can create as many lines as we want without needing a new line character, so the output would be;

cat message.txt

first message
second message
